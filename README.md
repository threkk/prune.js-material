> Prune.js is a tool created to detect dead code in JavaScript projects using ECMAScript 6.

This repository contains supporting material. 

## Configuration

Configuration files for [`prune.js`](https://github.com/threkk/prune.js). Read the
README of the tool to learn how to use them.

## Graphs

Graphs used in the paper. They are in three formats: `graphviz`, `eps` and `svg`.
Other formats can be generated using [Graphiz](https://graphviz.org/). They
represent the files in the `projects/` folders.

## Output

Output of the configurations in `configuration/` run with the projects in
`projects/`

## Projects

References to the exact commits of the projects used in the paper. They have
been added as submodules to ensure that the exact commit in which the output in
`output/` was generated is preserved.
